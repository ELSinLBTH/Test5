        <h3>Mill Harbour</h3>
        <p>
            Mill Harbour (Great Eastern Enterprise Centre) 3 Millharbour,6-8 South Quay Square
        </p>
        <p> 
            Construction has been on hold since the end of Q1 2022 and the scheme has not yet been launched. 
            The JRL Group has erected a temporary site office here, but this will serve other JRL projects on Marsh Wall and not this site.

        <h3>Poplar Business Park</h3>
        <p>
            Poplar Business Park - Manhattan Plaza 10 Prestons Way
        </p>
        <p>
            Telford has delivered 120 of the 321 private units permitted on site. These completed during Q4 2017 and sold out during Q2 2019.
            The remaining light industrial estate has permission for 222 units, including 201 private, 
            but Bloom and TPG Angelo Gordon has bought it with plans to retain it in industrial use.
        </p>

    <section id="RMG">
        <h3>Royal Mint Gardens</h3>
        <p>
            Royal Mint Gardens Chamber Street; Mansell Street 
        </p>
        <p>
            Phase 1 was DLR encapsulation works which completed in Q1 2018.
        </p>
        <p>
            Phase 2a is 254 units in Blocks B, C and D, which completed during Q1 2020. Around 235 units had sold by the end of Q4 2021 and the developer decided to rent the rest.
        </p>
        <p>
            Phase 2b has permission for an aparthotel and 79 private units in Block A. Application PA/15/02773 sought 196 residential units instead but was never approved. 
            More recently, application PA/22/01284 submitted on 16/12/2022 seeks to intensify the aparthotel use. However, there would still be 79 private units in the block. 
            Recent additions to the casefile suggest the application is still being pursued.

            The site for the remaining 167 units in Phase 2 remains partly in use as a shabby 
            industrial estate - there has been no further action on the planning or construction 
            fronts since Phase 1 sold out.
